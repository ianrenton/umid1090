# U.M.I.D. 1090 - The Unnecessary Military Interface for Dump1090

A wholly unnecessary replacement for Dump1090's web interface for tracking ADS-B equipped aircraft.

Uses the JSON format provided by an existing Dump1090 web server, but presents it using military symbology.

Just because you can, doesn't mean you should?
